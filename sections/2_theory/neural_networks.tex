\subsection{Neural Networks}
In understanding the subsequent sections, it will prove useful to have a grasp on the fundamental ideas behind neural networks - and in particular, deep neural networks. 
Neural networks were first introduced as a way of describing the complexities of the human brain in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts \autocite{pitts}.
\newline
Neural networks today, though, are significantly more complicated than the initial proposition by McCulloch and Pitts; they have become deeper and have adopted new techniques such as back propagation (commonly attributed to Paul John Werbos) allowing for neural networks to learn good internal representations. 
Furthermore, the advance in computing power, accessibility of computing resources via cloud computing and the open-sourcing of many machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Caffe and Torch have allowed for rapid advancement within the field.

These factors, and many others, have contributed to neural networks succeeding in tasks such as image classification, object detection, natural machine translation etc.
