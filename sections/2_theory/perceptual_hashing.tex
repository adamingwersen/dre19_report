\subsection{Perceptual Hashing}
A Hashing algorithm is intended to produce a \textit{fingerprint} of a file, e.g. an image. 
Cryptographic hashing algorithms such as \texttt{bcrypt} and \texttt{MD5}, produces this fingerprint in a way such that the same image, with only a single pixel altered, would result in a significantly different hash - this is called the \textit{The Avalanche Effect}.
Perceptual hashing algorithms on the other hand, would in the same scenario produce two very similar hashes. 
Perceptual hashing algorithms are therefore quite useful in detecting e.g. copyright infringements on photographs, logos, etc. 
There are many different perceptual hashing algorithms available - their fingerprints can typically be compared using the \textit{Hamming Distance}. 

In addressing similarity of images in terms of, say, aesthetic, layout, etc. perceptual hashing methods are probably not very effective.
This is due to the fact, that perceptual hashing methods rely on a per-pixel comparison, which will not hold for the proposed problem, as a photograph of the same kitchen may be taken from several different angles - and thus yield very dissimilar hashes. 
There are more sophisticated methodologies to address the problem of finding semantic similarities in images - some of which will be discussed further below.
