\subsection{Similarity}
In measuring similarity between images many different proposals for candidate methods surface. 
However, in the context of this project it is the aim to determine similarity between feature vectors obtained from e.g. autoencoders bottleneck layers.
This significantly simplifies the task as these feature vectors are 1-d arrays.
\newline
A well-established and conceptually simple metric for this usecase is the cosine similarity. 
It is commonly used in determining word-to-word similarity and na√Øve recommender systems. 
The cosine similarity is defined as:
$$
similarity(A,B) = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n A_{i}B_{i}}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n A_{i}^{2}} \sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n B_{i}^{2}}}
$$
Trivially, the distance between two vectors can be obtained by:
$$
cdist(A,B) = 1 - similarity(A,B)
$$
