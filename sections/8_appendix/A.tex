\subsection*{Appendix A: Data Labeling}\label{appendix: A}
In order to reduce the number of images to label, all images that could be easily determined to be primarily white/black images were discarded using mean-pixel values computations. 
See \url{datatools/utils/classify_greyscale.py} for implementation. 

Opening a folder with 22.000 images in an attempt to label them is taxing on hardware, and in order to alleviate the issue of a crashing file-manager GUI, data was split randomly into 20 subfolders using a shell script:
\begin{minted}{shell}
    for i in {1..20}
    do
	echo "Moving $1 images into $i"
        ls -Q images/ | head -$1 | xargs -i mv images/{} segments/$i
    done
\end{minted}

Finally the labeled data was split into train-test-val split using \url{datatolls/utils/split_data.py}.
